# nokiao_copilot_chat

Dash component wrapper for CopilotKit chat UI, designed for Agno AGUI runtime integration.

## Install

```shell
pip install nokiao_copilot_chat
```

## Quick Start (Agno AGUI)

```python
import dash
from dash import html
import nokiao_copilot_chat as ncc

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div(
    [
        ncc.NokiaoCopilotChat(
            id="copilot-chat",
            runtime_url="http://localhost:8000/agui",
            headers={"Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>"},
            labels={
                "initial": "Hi, how can I help you today?",
                "placeholder": "Ask anything...",
            },
        )
    ]
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Bridge Props for Dash Callbacks

- Output props: `thread_id`, `last_user_message`, `last_assistant_message`, `is_running`, `event_seq`
- Use `event_seq` as callback trigger, read the other fields as state snapshot.

## Development
### Getting Started

1. Create a new python environment:
   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   . venv/bin/activate
   ```
   _Note: venv\Scripts\activate for windows_

2. Install python dependencies:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install npm packages:
   1. Optional: use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node version:
      ```shell
      nvm install
      nvm use
      ```
   2. Install:
      ```shell
      npm install
      ```
4. Build:
   ```shell
   npm run build
   ```


### Create a production build and publish:

1. Clean up build and  dist - removes old and temp tarballs:
```
rm -rf dist build
```


2. Run a new build
```
npm install
npm run build
```

3. Build source distribution.  
```
npm run dist
```

4. Test your tarball by copying it into a new environment and installing it locally, for example:
```
pip install <your-project-name-version>.tar.gz
```

Note:  For local install, use:

```
pip install -e ./path-to-project
```


5. Publish on PyPI

Prepare release on the GitHub UI - For more information see [Managing Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)
When in doubt, do an alpha release first
```
$ twine upload dist/*
```
6. If publish on npm:

Note: Publishing your component to NPM will make the JavaScript bundles available on the unpkg CDN. By default, Dash serves the component library's CSS and JS locally, but if you choose to publish the package to NPM you can set `serve_locally` to `False` and you may see faster load times.
```
npm publish
``` 


### Justfile

Alternatively, use the provided [just](https://github.com/casey/just) commands:

1. Create a Python environment from previous step 1 and install:
   ```shell
   just install
   ```
2. Build
   ```shell
   just build
   ```
3. Publish
   ```shell
   just publish
   ```
4. See all commands with `just -l`
